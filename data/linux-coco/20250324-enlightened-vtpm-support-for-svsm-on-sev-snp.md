## [1] Stefano Garzarella — 2025-03-24

AMD SEV-SNP defined a new mechanism for adding privileged levels (VMPLs)
in the context of a Confidential VM. These levels can be used to run the
guest OS at a lower privilege level than a Secure VM Service Module (SVSM).
In this way SVSM can be used to emulate those devices (such as TPM) that
cannot be delegated to an untrusted host.

The guest OS can talk to SVSM using a specific calling convention and
instructions (a kind of system call/hyper call) and request services such
as TPM emulation.

The main goal of this series is to add a driver for the vTPM defined by
the AMD SVSM spec [3]. The specification defines a protocol that a
SEV-SNP guest OS (running on VMPL >= 1) can use to discover and talk to
a vTPM emulated by the SVSM in the guest context, but at a more
privileged level (VMPL0).

This series is based on the RFC sent by James last year [1].
In the meantime, the patches have been maintained and tested in the
Coconut Linux fork [2] along with the work to support the vTPM
emulation in Coconut SVSM.

The first patch adds public APIs to use AMD SVSM vTPM. They use
SVSM_VTPM_QUERY call to probe for the vTPM device and SVSM_VTPM_CMD call
to execute vTPM operations as defined in the AMD SVSM spec [3].
The second patch adds an interface with helpers for the SVSM_VTPM_CMD calls
used by the vTPM protocol defined by the AMD SVSM spec and then used by the
third patch to implement the SVSM vTPM driver. The fourth patch simply
registers the platform device.

Since all SEV-SNP dependencies are now upstream, this series can be
applied directly to the Linus' tree.

These patches were tested in an AMD SEV-SNP guest running:
- a recent version of Coconut SVSM [4] containing an ephemeral vTPM
- a PoC [5] containing a stateful vTPM used for sealing/unsealing a LUKS key

Changelog:

v3 -> v4
- Added more documentation around public API [Jarkko]
- Simplified TPM_SEND_COMMAND check [Tom/Jarkko]
- Renamed header in tpm_svsm.h so it will fall under TPM DEVICE DRIVER
  section [Borislav, Jarkko]
- Fixed several comments to improve svsm_vtpm_ helpers and structures [Jarkko]
- Moved "asm" includes after the "linux" includes [Tom]
- Allocated buffer used in the driver separately [Tom/Jarkko/Jason]
- Explained better why we register tpm-svsm device anyway in the commit message

v2 RFC -> v3: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20250311094225.35129-1-sgarzare@redhat.com/
- Removed send_recv() ops and followed the ftpm driver implementing .status,
  .req_complete_mask, .req_complete_val, etc. [Jarkko]
  As we agreed, I will send another series with that patch to continue the
  discussion along with the changes in this driver and ftpm driver.
- Renamed fill/parse functions [Tom]
- Renamed helpers header and prefix to make clear it's related to the
  SVSM vTPM protocol and not to the TCG TPM Simulator
- Slimmed down snp_svsm_vtpm_probe() [Borislav]
- Removed link to the spec because those URLs are unstable [Borislav]
- Removed features check and any print related [Tom]
- Squashed "x86/sev: add SVSM call macros for the vTPM protocol" patch
  with the next one [Borislav]

v1 -> v2 RFC: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20250228170720.144739-1-sgarzare@redhat.com/
- Added send_recv() tpm_class_ops callback
- Removed the intermediate tpm_platform.ko driver
- Renamed tpm_platform.h to tpm_tcgsim.h and included some API to fill
  TPM_SEND_COMMAND requests and parse responses from a device emulated using
  the TCG Simulatore reference implementation
- Added public API in x86/sev usable to discover and talk with the SVSM vTPM
- Added the tpm-svsm platform driver in driver/char/tpm/
- Fixed some SVSM TPM related issues (resp_size as u32, don't fail on
  features !=0, s/VTPM/vTPM)

v0 RFC -> v1: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20241210143423.101774-1-sgarzare@redhat.com/
- Used SVSM_VTPM_QUERY to probe the TPM as Tom Lendacky suggested
- Changed references/links to TCG TPM repo since in the last year MS
  donated the reference TPM implementation to the TCG.
- Addressed Dov Murik's comments:
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/f7d0bd07-ba1b-894e-5e39-15fb1817bc8b@linux.ibm.com/
- Added a new patch with SVSM call macros for the vTPM protocol, following
  what we already have for SVSM_CORE and SVSM_ATTEST
- Rebased on v6.13-rc2

Thanks,
Stefano

*Subject: [PATCH v4 1/4] x86/sev: add SVSM vTPM probe/send_command functions*

From: Stefano Garzarella <sgarzare@redhat.com>

Add two new functions to probe and send commands to the SVSM vTPM.
They leverage the two calls defined by the AMD SVSM specification [1]
for the vTPM protocol: SVSM_VTPM_QUERY and SVSM_VTPM_CMD.

Expose these functions to be used by other modules such as a tpm
driver.

- expanded headers to avoid obfuscation [Jarkko]
- used `buf` instead of `inbuf`/`outbuf` [Jarkko]
- added more documentation quoting the specification
- removed TPM_* macros since we only use TPM_SEND_COMMAND in one place

  directly as specified in the AMD SVSM specification

## [4] Stefano Garzarella — 2025-03-24
*Subject: [PATCH v4 3/4] tpm: add SNP SVSM vTPM driver*

From: Stefano Garzarella <sgarzare@redhat.com>

Add driver for the vTPM defined by the AMD SVSM spec [1].

The specification defines a protocol that a SEV-SNP guest OS can use to
discover and talk to a vTPM emulated by the Secure VM Service Module (SVSM)
in the guest context, but at a more privileged level (VMPL0).

The new tpm-svsm platform driver uses two functions exposed by x86/sev
to verify that the device is actually emulated by the platform and to
send commands and receive responses.

The device cannot be hot-plugged/unplugged as it is emulated by the
platform, so we can use module_platform_driver_probe(). The probe
function will only check whether in the current runtime configuration,
SVSM is present and provides a vTPM.

This device does not support interrupts and sends responses to commands
synchronously. In order to have .recv() called just after .send() in
tpm_try_transmit(), the .status() callback returns 0, and both
.req_complete_mask and .req_complete_val are set to 0.

*Subject: [PATCH v4 4/4] x86/sev: register tpm-svsm platform device*

From: Stefano Garzarella <sgarzare@redhat.com>

SNP platform can provide a vTPM device emulated by SVSM.

The "tpm-svsm" device can be handled by the platform driver added
by the previous commit in drivers/char/tpm/tpm_svsm.c

Register the device unconditionally. The support check (e.g. SVSM, cmd)
is in snp_svsm_vtpm_probe(), keeping all logic in one place.
This function is called during the driver's probe along with other
setup tasks like memory allocation.

Signed-off-by: Stefano Garzarella <sgarzare@redhat.com>

These should be defined static inline with trivial definitions in the
#else case, yes?

For now the only user of those is the tpm_svsm driver which is build 
only if CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT is defined, so there should be no 
problem, but you are right, better to follow the other functions and 
define the stubs

I'll fix in v5, good catch!

Thanks,

If this was bundled with the patch set, this would short a lot:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20250326161838.123606-1-jarkko@kernel.org/T/#u

So maybe for v5? Including this patch does not take send_recv()
out of consideration, it is just smart thing to do in all cases.

It would be probably easiest to roll out my patch together with
rest of the patch set.

Yeah, and you could simplify to goal in the other patch set: it's about
avoiding double-copy of a buffer.

It's a totally legit argument that we can measure. So in the end this
will help out landing that too because it takes away the extra cruft
and streamlines the goal.
