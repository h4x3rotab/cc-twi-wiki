## [1] Jiri Pirko — 2026-03-16

From: Jiri Pirko <jiri@nvidia.com>

Confidential computing (CoCo) VMs/guests, such as AMD SEV and Intel TDX,
run with encrypted/protected memory which creates a challenge
for devices that do not support DMA to it (no TDISP support).

For kernel-only DMA operations, swiotlb bounce buffering provides a
transparent solution by copying data through decrypted memory.
However, the only way to get this memory into userspace is via the DMA
API's dma_alloc_pages()/dma_mmap_pages() type interfaces which limits
the use of the memory to a single DMA device, and is incompatible with
pin_user_pages().

These limitations are particularly problematic for the RDMA subsystem
which makes heavy use of pin_user_pages() and expects flexible memory
usage between many different DMA devices.

This patch series enables userspace to explicitly request decrypted
(shared) memory allocations from new dma-buf system_cc_decrypted heap.
Userspace can mmap this memory and pass the dma-buf fd to other
existing importers such as RDMA or DRM devices to access the
memory. The DMA API is improved to allow the dma heap exporter to DMA
map the shared memory to each importing device.

Jiri Pirko (2):
  dma-mapping: introduce DMA_ATTR_CC_DECRYPTED for pre-decrypted memory
  dma-buf: heaps: system: add system_cc_decrypted heap for explicitly
    decrypted memory

*Subject: [PATCH v4 1/2] dma-mapping: introduce DMA_ATTR_CC_DECRYPTED for pre-decrypted memory*

From: Jiri Pirko <jiri@nvidia.com>

Current CC designs don't place a vIOMMU in front of untrusted devices.
Instead, the DMA API forces all untrusted device DMA through swiotlb
bounce buffers (is_swiotlb_force_bounce()) which copies data into
decrypted memory on behalf of the device.

When a caller has already arranged for the memory to be decrypted
via set_memory_decrypted(), the DMA API needs to know so it can map
directly using the unencrypted physical address rather than bounce
buffering. Following the pattern of DMA_ATTR_MMIO, add
DMA_ATTR_CC_DECRYPTED for this purpose. Like the MMIO case, only the
caller knows what kind of memory it has and must inform the DMA API
for it to work correctly.

## [3] Jiri Pirko — 2026-03-16
*Subject: [PATCH v4 2/2] dma-buf: heaps: system: add system_cc_decrypted heap for explicitly decrypted memory*

From: Jiri Pirko <jiri@nvidia.com>

Add a new "system_cc_decrypted" dma-buf heap to allow userspace to
allocate decrypted (shared) memory for confidential computing (CoCo)
VMs.

On CoCo VMs, guest memory is encrypted by default. The hardware uses an
encryption bit in page table entries (C-bit on AMD SEV, "shared" bit on
Intel TDX) to control whether a given memory access is encrypted or
decrypted. The kernel's direct map is set up with encryption enabled,
so pages returned by alloc_pages() are encrypted in the direct map
by default. To make this memory usable for devices that do not support
DMA to encrypted memory (no TDISP support), it has to be explicitly
decrypted. A couple of things are needed to properly handle
decrypted memory for the dma-buf use case:

- set_memory_decrypted() on the direct map after allocation:
  Besides clearing the encryption bit in the direct map PTEs, this
  also notifies the hypervisor about the page state change. On free,
  the inverse set_memory_encrypted() must be called before returning
  pages to the allocator. If re-encryption fails, pages
  are intentionally leaked to prevent decrypted memory from being
  reused as private.

- pgprot_decrypted() for userspace and kernel virtual mappings:
  Any new mapping of the decrypted pages, be it to userspace via
  mmap or to kernel vmalloc space via vmap, creates PTEs independent
  of the direct map. These must also have the encryption bit cleared,
  otherwise accesses through them would see encrypted (garbage) data.

- DMA_ATTR_CC_DECRYPTED for DMA mapping:
  Since the pages are already decrypted, the DMA API needs to be
  informed via DMA_ATTR_CC_DECRYPTED so it can map them correctly
  as unencrypted for device access.

On non-CoCo VMs, the system_cc_decrypted heap is not registered
to prevent misuse by userspace that does not understand
the security implications of explicitly decrypted memory.

Echoing Jason's point, if the intent of this is to indicate shared 
memory, please call it DMA_ATTR_CC_SHARED. Yes, some of the existing 
APIs are badly named because they conflated intent with implementation 
details; that is no reason to keep wilfully making the same mistake.

At least with Arm CCA, the architecture enforces *confidentiality* 
pretty much orthogonally to encryption - if your threat model excludes 
physical attacks against DRAM, you can still have Realms isolated from 
each other (and of course other execution states) without even 
implementing the memory encryption feature; conversely if you do have 
it, then even all the shared/host memory may still be physically 
encrypted, it just has its own context (key) distinct from the Realm 
ones. Similarly, while it's not a "true" CoCo environment, pKVM has a 
similar notion of shared vs. private which can benefit from 
piggy-backing off much of the CoCo infrastructure in places like the DMA 
layer, but has nothing whatsoever to do with actual encryption.

Furthermore, "shared" is just shorter and more readable, even before I 
invoke the previous discussion of why it should be "unencrypted" rather 
than "decrypted" anyway ;)

...although, why *shouldn't* this be allowed with a vIOMMU? (Especially 
given that a vIOMMU for untrusted devices can be emulated by the host 
VMM without the CoCo hypervisor having to care at all - again, at least 
on Arm and other architectures where IOMMUs are regular driver model 
devices)

Or indeed any other non-direct ops? Obviously all the legacy 
architectures like Alpha are never going to see this or care, but I 
could imagine Xen and possibly PowerPC might.

Yeah, I wanted to draw the full picture. I can put a not like "(when it

Well, when iommu path is able to consume the attr, this restriction
should be lifted. This is basically a sanity check for the
dma_map_phys() caller.

Hi Jiri,

I wonder if it'd better to call this cc_decrypted (or I guess
cc_shared based on Robin's comment in the previous patch) like the DMA
attr? There's a separate effort for "restricted" heaps with TEE for
(encrypted) video playback, which doesn't involve VMs or RDMA. I think
the cc_ prefix might help avoid any confusion between the usecase here
and restricted heaps.

Sure. I'll rename this.

Thanks!

Right we eventually need a matching IOMMU_DECRYPTED.

It needs to mirror how the CPUs work - any place that would use
pgprot_decrypted to create a PTE should use IOMMU_PROT_DECRYPTED to
create an iommu mapping.

The current hack in AMD assumes IOMMU_DECRYPTED behavior for
IOMMU_MMIO, but that isn't general enough..

There is some maze to get there but for the moment I think it is fine
to just not support vIOMMU, it isn't like any vIOMMU drivers even
exist for CC VMs right now.
